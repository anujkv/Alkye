#This is a basic workflow for build and deploying with the master branch now, but we can add multiple steps for other
#branches as well as.

#start with actions.
name: Build & Deploy
#control when the action will run.
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

#allow you to run this workflow manually from the actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

#A work run is made up of one or more jobs that can  run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  #this job contains a single job called 'build'
  build:
    #the type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    #steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      #checkout repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      #runs a single command using the runner shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, World!

      #runs multiple commands using the runner shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test and deploy the project.
